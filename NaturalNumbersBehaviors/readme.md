So, we are doing this:

+ input initial number **n**
+ if this number is even, divide it by two - **n=n/2**
+ if this number is odd, multiply by three and add one - **n=n*3+1**
+ our goal is to know, ho many steps each n number need, until it be transformed to 1 


This table shows how many steps do numbers need in range 1 from 1000:
